# Introduction

## Machine Learning

* [_**Machine learning**_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning) is like teaching computers to learn and make decisions, just like how you learn from your experiences. It's like showing a computer lots of examples and letting it figure things out on its own, so it can do tasks or answer questions without being told exactly what to do. Imagine it as if the computer is becoming smarter by itself, like a robot that learns from its adventures!

### Data

Imagine that data is like the ingredients for a magic recipe that helps computers learn. Just like a chef needs good ingredients to make a delicious meal, a computer needs good data to learn correctly. So, if our data isn't clean and right, it's like using bad ingredients in our recipe. And just like how a tasty meal depends on the quality of ingredients, the computer's learning depends on the quality of data. So, making sure our data is clean and filled with good information is super important for our computer to make the right decisions!

There is a famous quote by [_**Daniel Keys Moran**_ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel\_Keys\_Moran)

> &#x20;                    _**You can have data without information,**_&#x20;

And the more data we have, the easier our job becomes to train models.

### Types of machine learning&#x20;

There are four main types of machine learning.

* Supervised Machine Learning
* Semi-Supervised Machine Learning
* Unsupervised Machine Learning
* Reinforcement Learning

### Supervised Machine Learning ->

Let's take a deep breath and think about how we humans learn in our daily lives. You might say, "Well, we humans perform actions, observe how they turn out, and if they go well, we call it a success. If they don't, we take corrective measures and learn from our mistakes so we don't repeat them, right?" Similarly, in supervised machine learning, we gather a set of examples and provide them to our machine learning model. If the model produces good results, we provide positive feedback, and the model learns from this feedback. Later, the model might suggest, "Hey, this approach worked for someone else; maybe it'll work for you." This feedback loop continues, and our machine learning model keeps improving.

Que ;-( But hey have you ever thought is it really necessary that a model can learn only from large CSV files and text files ?&#x20;

Ans ;-) Data could be of any type. It could be a set of images, CSV files, json files etc.
