# Introduction
* Machine learning is like teaching computers to learn and make decisions, just like how you learn from your experiences. It's like showing a computer lots of examples and letting it figure things out on its own, so it can do tasks or answer questions without being told exactly what to do. Imagine it as if the computer is becoming smarter by itself, like a robot that learns from its adventures!
