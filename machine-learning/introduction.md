# Introduction

## Machine Learning

* [_**Machine learning**_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning) is like teaching computers to learn and make decisions, just like how you learn from your experiences. It's like showing a computer lots of examples and letting it figure things out on its own, so it can do tasks or answer questions without being told exactly what to do. Imagine it as if the computer is becoming smarter by itself, like a robot that learns from its adventures!

### Data

Data is the most important part of machine learning and whatever our machine learning model learns whether it's wrong or right it depends on multiple factors and the dataset is one of those factors if the data is not good then our model will give us wrong outputs. The cleanliness of data and information inside it does matter alot.

there is a famous quote by [_**Daniel Keys Moran**_ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel\_Keys\_Moran)

> You can have data without information, but you cannot have information without data.
