# Introduction

## Machine Learning

* [_**Machine learning**_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning) is like teaching computers to learn and make decisions, just like how you learn from your experiences. It's like showing a computer lots of examples and letting it figure things out on its own, so it can do tasks or answer questions without being told exactly what to do. Imagine it as if the computer is becoming smarter by itself, like a robot that learns from its adventures!

### Data

Imagine that data is like the ingredients for a magic recipe that helps computers learn. Just like a chef needs good ingredients to make a delicious meal, a computer needs good data to learn correctly. So, if our data isn't clean and right, it's like using bad ingredients in our recipe. And just like how a tasty meal depends on the quality of ingredients, the computer's learning depends on the quality of data. So, making sure our data is clean and filled with good information is super important for our computer to make the right decisions!

There is a famous quote by [_**Daniel Keys Moran**_ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel\_Keys\_Moran)

> You can have data without information, but you cannot have information without data.
